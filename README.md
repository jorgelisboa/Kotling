# Kotling

Well, I made this project looking some things on internet like, [Material Design](https://material.io/design) and [Binding](https://proandroiddev.com/databinding-in-android-b3cb41a8e0c5).

This is not finished yet, but now I just need to use `Retrofit` with Kotlin to finish my studies in the mobile native development.
